Welcome to the |EX-IO| download page. You have several choices:

* **[RECOMMENDED]** If you are a |conductor-text|, or you just want an easy installer to do the work for you, go to the :doc:`/download/ex-installer` page.
* If you are a |tinkerer-text| the :doc:`/download/ex-installer` is still the recommended solution, but if would like to download a zip file and install the firmware using the |Arduino IDE| or |VSC|, go to the :ref:`download/ex-ioexpander:download the source code` section.

.. important:: 

   We **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** downloading and using :doc:`/download/ex-installer` to install the software, especially for |conductor-text| and |tinkerer-text| users.
   
   While it is possible install the software using the |Arduino IDE|, we *seriously* **DO NOT RECOMMEND IT**. It is an order of magnitude more complex, much slower, and with a very high probability of getting something wrong unless you really know what you are doing.

   |EX-I| will meet 100% of the needs of a |conductor-text| or |tinkerer-text| with considerably less effort.
